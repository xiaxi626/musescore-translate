### Add symbol {#add-symbol}

To add a breath, or pause (aka _caesura_ / "tram lines" / "railroad tracks") to the score, use one of the following options:

* Select a note or rest and click a breath or pause symbol in a palette (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).
* Drag  a breath or pause symbol from a palette onto a note or rest in the score.

The symbol is placed _after_ the note. Its position can be adjusted by editing the X and Y offsets in the [node:278642,fragment="element",title="Inspector"], or, in [node:278587,fragment="enter-exit",title="edit mode"], using the [node:278587,fragment="keyboard-shortcuts",title="arrow keys"].

### Adjust pause length {#adjust-pause-length}

You can adjust the pause length (in seconds) of the added symbol in the [node:278642,title="Inspector"].
