4. Upon successfully logging in, you'll be able to enter your score information.

 [inline:window_save_online_score_information.png=Enter the score information]

    * __Title__: The title of the score.
    * __Description__: The descriptive text that will appear next to it.
    * __Make the score private__: If ticked, the score can only be viewed via a private link. If unticked, the score is visible to all.
    * __License__: Choose an appropriate copyright license from the drop-down list. __Note__: [Creative Commons license](//creativecommons.org), allows people to use your scores under certain restrictions.
    * __Tags__: You can add **tags** to help identify scores on MuseScore.com. Use commas to separate multiple tags.
5. If the score already exists online, it will be updated automatically—you can add additional information in the changelog section of the dialog if required. This can retrieved on MuseScore.com under "Revision history" for that score. Uncheck **Update the existing score** to save online as a new score.

6. If you are using a different [node:278624,title="SoundFont"] than the default one and if you are able to export [node:278612,title="MP3 files",fragment="mp3"] (may not be the case on some Linux versions), a checkbox __Upload score audio__ will be visible:
 [inline:Upload_score_audio_en.png=Upload score audio]
 If the checkbox is checked, MuseScore will render the audio of the score using the current [node:278660,title="synthesizer"] settings and upload the audio to MuseScore.com.

### Upload a score on MuseScore.com {#upload-a-score-on-musescore-com}

You can also upload a score MuseScore.com itself:

1. Click the [Upload link](//musescore.com/upload?utm_source=handbook) on MuseScore.com.
2. You have the same options as with the Save Online menu.
3. You also have access to more information, such as **Genre**.

### Edit a score on MuseScore.com {#edit-a-score-on-musescore-com}

If you want to make changes to one of your scores on MuseScore.com, edit the MuseScore file on your own computer, save it, and then do the following:

* If you originally shared the score [directly from within MuseScore](#direct), simply go to <samp class="menu">File</samp>&rarr;<samp class="menuitem">Save Online...</samp> again to update the online score.
* If you originally [uploaded the score](#upload-a-score-on-musescore-com) via the [Upload page](//musescore.com/upload?utm_source=handbook) on MuseScore.com, then you must follow these steps to update the online score:
 1. Go to the score page on MuseScore.com.
 2. Click the three dots menu <kbd><samp class="menu">⋮</samp></kbd> on the right and choose "Update this score".
 3. In the form, you can upload a replacement score file as well as change the accompanying information and privacy settings.

#### Switch to the direct method of updating an online score {#switch-to-direct-method}

It is much more convenient to update online scores from directly within MuseScore than by updating the score manually from the score page. Follow these steps if you originally uploaded the score via the [Upload page](//musescore.com/upload?utm_source=handbook) and now want to switch to the direct method:

1. Go to the score page on MuseScore.com and copy the URL.
2. Open the score file on your computer with MuseScore.
3. From the menu, select <samp class="menu">File</samp>&rarr;<samp class="menuitem">Score Properties...</samp> and paste the URL into the "Source" field.

Now whenever you want to update the online score simply go to <samp class="menu">File</samp>&rarr;<samp class="menuitem">Save Online...</samp>.
