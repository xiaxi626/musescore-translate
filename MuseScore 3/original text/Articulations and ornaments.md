### Add articulation/ornament {#add}

Use either of the following methods:

* [node:278652,title="Select"] a note or a [node:278652,fragment="range-select",title="range"] of notes, then click a symbol in a palette (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).
* Drag a symbol from a palette onto a notehead.

#### Add accidental to an ornament {#accidental}

To apply an accidental to an existing ornament, such as a trill:

1. Select the note to which the ornament is attached;
2. Open the [node:278649,fragment="symbols",title="Symbols section"] of the [node:278649,title="Master palette"];
3. Search for and [node:278649,fragment="apply-symbol",title="apply"] the desired accidental to the score (small accidentals can be found using the search term "figured bass");
4. Drag the accidental into position (or reposition using [node:278587,fragment="keyboard-shortcuts",title="keyboard shortcuts"] or the [node:278642,fragment="element",title="Inspector"]).

#### Add fermata to a barline {#barline}

Use one of the following methods:

* Select a [node:278593,title="barline"], then click a fermata symbol in a palette (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).
* Drag a fermata  symbol from a palette onto a barline in the score.

_Note_: This does not affect [node:278604,fragment="fermata",title="playback"].

#### Keyboard shortcuts {#shortcuts}

* Toggle Staccato: <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd></kbd>
* Toggle Tenuto: <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd></kbd>

Keyboard shortcuts can be customized in MuseScore's [node:278648,fragment="shortcuts",title="Preferences"].

### Adjust position {#adjust-position}

Immediately after adding an articulation or ornament from a palette, the symbol is automatically selected: It can then be moved _up or down_ from the keyboard as follows:

* Press up/down arrow keys for fine positioning (0.1 sp at a time);
* Press <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>&uarr;</kbd></kbd> or <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>&darr;</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>&uarr;</kbd></kbd> or <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>&darr;</kbd></kbd>) for larger vertical adjustments (1 sp at a time).
* To flip a symbol to the other side of the note (where applicable), select it and press <kbd><kbd>X</kbd></kbd>.

To enable adjustments in _all_ directions from the keyboard:

1. Enter [node:278587,fragment="enter-edit-mode",title="Edit mode"] on the symbol;
2. Press arrow keys for fine positioning (0.1 sp at a time); or press <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Arrow</kbd></kbd> (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Arrow</kbd></kbd>) for larger adjustments (1 sp at a time).

You can also change the horizontal and vertical offset values in the [node:278642,title="Inspector"]. To position more than one symbol at a time, select the desired symbols and adjust the offset values in the Inspector.

__Note__: The symbol can also be repositioned by clicking and dragging, but for more precise control, use the methods above.

### Articulation and ornament properties {#properties}

These can be edited from the __Articulation__ section of the [node:278642,title="Inspector"] and may include:

* __Placement__: Above or below the staff.
* __Direction__: Auto / Up / Down.
* __Anchor__: Adjust the vertical placement of the symbol.
* __Time stretch__: For fermatas, adjust the pause length.
