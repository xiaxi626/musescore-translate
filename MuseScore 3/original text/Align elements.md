To enable snap to grid, select an element and click one or both of the snap to grid buttons, located to the right of the X (horizontal) and Y (vertical) offset fields in the [node:278642,title="Inspector"]. You can then _drag_ the element in steps equal to the __grid spacing__. The default value is 0.5 [node:278598,fragment="spatium",title="sp"].

To change the __grid spacing__:

1. Right-click on any of the snap to grid buttons in the Inspector, and select  <kbd><samp class="menuitem">Configure Grid</samp></kbd>.
2. Set values for the horizontal and vertical grid spacing as required. Note that this is a fractional setting.
