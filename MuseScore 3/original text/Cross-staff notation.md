In piano scores, it is common to write a musical phrase extending across both stavesâ€”bass and treble. This can be entered in MuseScore as follows:

1. Enter the notation in one staff to begin with. e.g.

 [inline:crossbeams1.png=Beamed notes in upper staff]

2. Select a note and press <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> + &darr;/&uarr; (Mac: <kbd><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> + &darr;/&uarr;). This moves all the notes in that [node:278602,title="voice"] down/up to the other staff. e.g.

 [inline:crossbeams1a.png=Selected note moved to lower staff]
 
 _Note_: If you only want to move certain notes in a chord you need to ensure that they are in a separate voice.

3. To adjust the beam, double-click it to show the handles. Use the [node:278587,fragment="keyboard-shortcuts",title="keyboard arrows"] or drag the handles to change the beam angle and height:
