MuseScore provides __brackets__ and a curly __brace__ in the __Brackets__ [node:278614,title="palette"] (Advanced [node:281353,title="workspace"]).

When a new score is created using a template, MuseScore automatically sets the correct brackets.

### Add {#add}

To add a bracket or brace to systems, use one of two methods:

* Select a measure on the staff where you want the bracket/brace to start, and click the desired icon in a palette (double-click in versions prior to 3.4).
* Drag a bracket/brace icon from a palette on to the staff where you want the bracket/brace to start.


### Delete {#delete}

* Select the bracket and press <kbd><kbd>Del</kbd></kbd>.

### Change {#change}

* Drag the desired icon from a palette onto an existing bracket/brace in the score.

### Edit {#edit}

When you first apply a bracket it only spans one staff. To extend to other staves:

1. Enter [node:278587,fragment="enter-exit",title="Edit mode"].
2. Drag the handle downwards to span the required staves. The handle snaps into position, so exact placement is not required.

### Style {#format}

The default thickness and distance from the system of brackets and braces can be adjusted in [node:278570,fragment="style-system",title="Format→ Style... → System"].

In the __System Brackets__ section, you can set the properties for the brackets in the two boxes on the left, and the properties for the braces in the two boxes on the right.
