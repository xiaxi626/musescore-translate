Audio playback is provided by MuseScore's onboard [node:278660,title="synthesizer"], which houses a large selection of __virtual__ (or __software__) __instruments__â€”including percussion and sound effects.

MuseScore supports virtual instruments in two formats:

* [SoundFont](#soundfonts) (.sf2/.sf3): A single file containing one or more virtual instruments.
* [SFZ](#sfz) (.sfz): A set of audio and definition files containing one or more virtual instruments.

### SoundFonts {#soundfonts}

MuseScore comes with its own GM ([General MIDI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_MIDI)) SoundFont, __MuseScore_General.sf3__, containing over 128 instruments, sound effects and various drum/percussion kits.

GM (General MIDI) is a universal format, so once your score is set up for correct playback using MuseScore's native Soundfont, you should be able to [node:278643,fragment="export",title="export"] it in a [node:278612, title="format"] of your choice and have it play back on any other user's computer.

Many different Soundfonts are available on the Internet: some free, some commercial. For a list of free soundfonts, see [below](#list).

#### Install a SoundFont {#install}

After finding and decompressing a SoundFont (see &rarr;[below](#list)), double-click to open it. In most cases, the SoundFont file type will already be associated with MuseScore, and MuseScore will start and a dialog will appear asking if you want to install the SoundFont. Occasionally an application other than MuseScore will be associated with the SoundFont file type; if this is the case, you will need to right-click or <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd></kbd>-click on the file, so as to display a menu from which you can choose to open the file in MuseScore. In either case, when the dialog appears asking if you want to install the SoundFont, click "Yes" to place a copy of the SoundFont file in MuseScore's SoundFonts directory. This directory can be viewed or changed in MuseScore's Preferences, but the default location is:

- Windows: `%HOMEPATH%\Documents\MuseScore3\Soundfonts`

- macOS and Linux: `~/Documents/MuseScore3/Soundfonts`

In contrast to user-added SoundFonts, the initial default SoundFont installed with MuseScore is located in a system directory, meant only for that purpose, which should _not_ be modified. This directory and its default SoundFont file is:

- Windows x86 (32-bit) / MuseScore x86: `%ProgramFiles%\MuseScore 3\sound\MuseScore_General.sf3`
- Windows x64 (64-bit) / MuseScore x86: `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\MuseScore 3\sound\MuseScore_General.sf3`
- Windows x64 (64-bit) / MuseScore x86_64: `%ProgramFiles%\MuseScore 3\sound\MuseScore_General.sf3`

- macOS: `/Applications/MuseScore 3.app/Contents/Resources/sound/MuseScore_General.sf3`

- Linux (Ubuntu): `/usr/share/mscore-xxx/sounds/MuseScore_General.sf3` (with `xxx` being the MuseScore version)

#### Uninstall {#uninstall}

To uninstall a SoundFont, simply open the folder where its file is installed and delete it.

### SFZ  {#sfz}

An SFZ is a collection of files and directories, an SFZ file and a bunch of actual sound files in WAV or FLAC format, with the SFZ file being a text file that basically describes what sound file is located where and to be used for what instrument and pitch range.

#### Install an SFZ {#install-sfz}

After downloading an SFZ (see &rarr;[below](#list)), you need to manually extract all the files that belong to the SFZ (the SFZ file(s) and all the sub-directories and other files) into the directory listed [above](#install). Leave the sub-directories and their contents as they are.  Note, however, that on occasion, an SFZ file in its folder may seek the actual WAV sound files inside the SFZ sub-directory itself, usually in a folder labeled "Libs".  If the SFZ zip file you download has a Libs folder in it, move it into the main SFZ sub-directory.

#### Uninstall {#uninstall-sfz}

To uninstall an SFZ, simply open the folder where its files are installed (see [above](#install)) and delete them all.

### Synthesizer {#synthesizer}

Once a SoundFont has been [installed](#install) on your system, it also needs to be loaded into the [node:278660,title=Synthesizer"]. See [node:278660,fragment="load-soundfont",title="To load a soundfont"]. 

### Mixer {#mixer}

The Mixer allows you to easily change the sounds for each staff (even while the score is playing). For further details, see [node:278583,title="Mixer"].

### List of downloadable soundfonts {#list}

#### GM SoundFonts {#gm_soundfonts}

The following sound libraries conform to the General MIDI (GM2) standard. This specification gives you a sound set of 128 virtual instruments, plus percussion kits.

#### Unzipping downloaded soundfonts {#compressed-file-formats}

Since soundfonts are large, they are often zipped (compressed) into a variety of formats, including .zip, .sfArk, and .tar.gz. You need to unzip (decompress) these files before they can be used.

- ZIP is standard compression format supported by most operating systems.

- sfArk is a compression format designed especially for compressing SoundFont files. To decompress it, use [Polyphone](https://www.polyphone-soundfonts.com/en) (cross-platform software); or this online service: https://cloudconvert.com/sfark-to-sf2

- .tar.gz is a popular compression format for Linux. Windows users can use [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org); Mac users can use [The Unarchiver](http://unarchiver.c3.cx/unarchiver), or macOS' built-in Archive Utility. Note that if using 7-Zip, you will need to apply decompression twiceâ€”once for GZip and once for TAR.

### Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

If the toolbar play panel is greyed out, or not visible, follow the instructions below to get your sound working again:

1. Right-click on the menu bar and make sure there is a check mark next to the <samp class="menuitem">Playback Controls</samp> menu item. If this step does not solve your problem, go to Step 2.
2. If the play panel disappears after changing the SoundFont, go to <samp class="menu">Edit</samp> &rarr; <samp class="menuitem">Preferences...</samp> &rarr; <samp class="tab">I/O</samp> tab and click OK without making any changes. After restarting MuseScore, the play panel should reappear.

If you are setting up a SoundFont for the first time, please use one of the recommended SoundFonts listed above.

If playback stutters, then your computer may not be able to handle the SoundFont being used. The following advice may help:

* Reduce the amount of RAM (memory) used by MuseScore by using a smaller SoundFont. See the [list](#list) above for suggestions.
* Increase the amount of RAM available for MuseScore by quitting all applications except MuseScore. If you still have problems and a large SoundFont is important to you, consider more RAM for your computer.
