MuseScore's __image capture__ feature allows you to save a snapshot of any part of the score window. PNG, PDF and SVG formats are supported.

### Save a snapshot {#save-snapshot}

1. Click on the __Toggle image capture__ button, [inline:Photo_Mode_Button.png=Image capture button].
2. Press <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></kbd> + drag, to create a new selection rectangle.
3. Fine tune the rectangle position, if required, by dragging it and/or changing the "Position" values in the "Image Capture" section of the [node:278642,title="Inspector"].
4. Fine tune the rectangle area, if required, by dragging the handles, and/or changing the "Size" values in the Inspector.
5. Right-click on the selection rectangle to open the __Image Capture__ menu. Select the desired option:
 * __Save As (Print Mode)__. This saves an image of the selection area as it would look if printed, e.g.

 * __Save as (Screenshot Mode)__. This saves a selection of the actual screen, including any line break symbols, invisible elements etc., e.g.
 [inline:Photo_Mode_Screenshot.png=Image capture snippet]

 You can save the image in either PNG (default), SVG or PDF format.
