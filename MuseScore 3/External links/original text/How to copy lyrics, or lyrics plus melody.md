3. Select a [node:36116,fragment="command-summary",title="copy"] command option;
4. Click on the note in the "recipient" staff where you want the lyrics to start. Use one of the  [node:36116,fragment="command-summary",title="paste"] options.

### Option 2: Copy lyrics and melody together

1. [node:41601,title="Select"] a range of notes in the "donor" staff;
2. Select a [node:36116,fragment="command-summary",title="copy"] command option (this copies both notes and accompanying lyrics);
3. [node:36116,fragment="command-summary",title="Paste"] to another staff;
4. Adjust the pitches if required (you can reenter the notes without changing the original rhythm using [node:197326,fragment="repitch",title="Repitch"] mode).
