This short tutorial guides you through the process of creating a new score in MuseScore.

It assumes you have MuseScore 3.5.0 or above, and [NVDA 2016.1](http://www.nvaccess.org/download/) or later installed. If you have a Braille display, it is suggested that you use this as well.

### Getting started
By default, MuseScore opens with a blank score entitled ‘My_First_score’. Later, you can change this so that MuseScore either starts with a new score, the score you were last working on, or with any specific score you choose.

### New score wizard
MuseScore can guide you through the creation of a new score via the ‘New Score Wizard’. You can launch this by going to <kbd><samp class="menu">File</samp> &rarr; <samp class="menuitem">New...</samp></kbd> or use the shortcut <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd></kbd>. The New Score Wizard contains four pages.

In the first page, focus is placed in the title field where you can insert the name of your new score. Once completed, tab to the next box for subtitle, and so on for composer, lyricist and copyright. All fields are optional.

When completed, press <kbd><samp class="button">Next &gt;</samp></kbd>.

The second screen of the new score wizard allows you to specify the instruments and/or voices in your score. For convenience, MuseScore includes several templates for common scorings such as SATB for four-part voices, or string quartet or jazz ensemble. You can also select your own custom scoring.

Focus starts in a search box where you can search for a template. Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to move to the list of available templates. The templates are grouped into categories. Press the <kbd><kbd>Up</kbd></kbd> or <kbd><kbd>Down</kbd></kbd> arrow keys to move through the list, and the <kbd>Right</kbd> and <kbd>Left</kbd> arrow keys to open or close each category.

If you don’t want any of the preset templates, the first option within the General category is ‘Choose Instruments’. Press <kbd><kbd>Enter</kbd></kbd> to choose your own instruments. 

You will now see a list of instruments grouped into genres including:

  - All instruments
  - Common
  - Pop/Rock
  - Jazz
  - Choral
  - Orchestra
etc.

Select any of these genres using <kbd><kbd>Up</kbd></kbd> or <kbd><kbd>Down</kbd></kbd> arrow keys, then press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to put focus on the instrument categories. This is a tree view, so press <kbd><kbd>Right</kbd></kbd> arrow to open the tree and <kbd><kbd>Left</kbd></kbd> arrow to close it again. Once you have found the instrument you require, press <kbd><kbd>Tab</kbd></kbd> once to the <kbd><samp class="button">Add</samp></kbd> button. You can repeat this process as many times as you wish.

_Note_: The appropriate clef is automatically selected for each instrument.

Once you have selected the instruments/voices for your score, press <kbd><samp class="button">Next &gt;</samp></kbd>.

The third screen of the New Score Wizard lets you select the key signature for your piece. Use the arrow keys to select the key you want and then press <kbd><samp class="button">Next &gt;</samp></kbd> to move to the final screen of the New Score Wizard.

_Note_: Once the score has been set up, it is possible to select another key signature by going to the master key palette by pressing <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd></kbd> with focus at the correct point in the score.

The final screen lets you select the time signature, optional pickup bar (anacrusis), the number of bars and  optional tempo.

There are three radio buttons for selecting the time signature. The first allows you to select a custom numerical time signature and the second two are for common time and cut common time. If you choose a numerical time signature, two more fields appear where you can select the number of beats per bar and then the beat denomination. These are both spin boxes, so use the <kbd>Up</kbd> and <kbd>Down</kbd> arrow keys.

Press <kbd><kbd>Tab</kbd></kbd> and a check box allows you to specify whether or not your piece has an anacrusis. Press <kbd><kbd>Space</kbd></kbd> to tick or untick the check box. If ticked, you can tab to two further edit boxes to select the number and type of beat of the anacrusis.

Press <kbd><kbd>Tab</kbd></kbd> again to select the number of bars in your piece. Again it is a spin box so you can either type a value directly or use the <kbd><kbd>Up</kbd></kbd> or <kbd><kbd>Down</kbd></kbd> arrow keys. You can add or remove bars later on if needed.

Press <kbd><kbd>Tab</kbd></kbd> to select whether or not a tempo indication is included. Press <kbd><kbd>Space</kbd></kbd> to tick or untick the tempo indication check box. Then press <kbd><kbd>Tab</kbd></kbd> to select the beats per minute. This is a spin box so use up and down arrows to select the beats per minute.

Press <kbd><samp class="button">Finish</samp></kbd> to complete the wizard. Focus will be left at the beginning of your piece. 

You are now ready to start [node:120426,title="Entering notes into your score"].
