The following Community Guidelines are here to help you understand what it means to be a member of Musescore.com. Don't forget that your use of Musescore.com is subject to these Guidelines and our [Terms of Service](https://musescore.com/legal/terms). Musescore.com is similar to other online communities, and you probably already have an idea of what to expect and how to behave. But just to be sure, here are some specifics.

###  What To Do
- **Share your own music as you wish.** The main purpose of Musescore.com is to let you share your music, so we encourage you to do that! When you create something original, you own the copyright for it, and your work is protected by law. You can upload your score under a [Creative Commons license](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fcreativecommons.org%2Flicenses%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHLu48i78kW59JpIdObQg7lIz00Cw) to give others permission to use your music in only the ways you specify.
- **Be nice.** Musescore.com is a worldwide community, and there are many different people with many different ideas and opinions here. This is a good thing, but be respectful of the fact that not everyone will always feel the same way as you, and try to keep disagreements civil. Treat people the way you would like to be treated.
- **Respect copyright.** Just as you own the copyright for music you create, others own the copyright for music they create. You may transcribe other people’s copyrighted music using Musescore, but you do not necessarily own the copyright for the resulting Sheet music. You may still upload it to Musescore.com, but please use appropriate privacy settings so that you are not sharing this music any more widely than the law allows. Note that the copyrights on most “classical” compositions have expired, so posting your transcriptions of Bach, Beethoven, and so forth is fine.
- **Link back to Musescore.com when you post your content elsewhere.** When embedding a score hosted on Musescore.com into a page on an external site, please include a link to the page for that score on Musescore.com. That way, people viewing your scores on other sites can also get to your pages on this site, and the community grows.
###  What Not To Do:
- **Don’t share anything publicly that you don’t have the right to.** As stated above, you may not share something publicly if someone else owns the copyright to it, unless of course they have given you permission.
- **Don’t share offensive content publicly.** We don’t want to stifle your creativity, and if you have written a song that you think is great but might nevertheless offend some others, we don’t want to forbid you from uploading it. But please use the privacy settings so that the people who might be offended don’t see it in the first place.
- **Don’t be rude in your comments or behavior.** Musescore.com provides facilities to let you write descriptions of your music, comment about other people’s music, and participate in discussions. I’m sure you can think of a hundred ways to abuse those privileges and really annoy people. Don’t do it.
- **Don’t spam.** Content regarded as “spam“ (except for scores without ads) will be deleted from the site. MuseScore users spreading spam will be banned. “ Spam“ includes:

1. ads & self-promotion (including irrelevant links)
2. posts made of random characters
3. MuseScore groups created for spam
4. multiple MuseScore discussions with the links to the same scores
- **Don’t violate MuseScore’s ethical principles.** The following actions are regarded as violations:
1. bullying of any kind
2. discrimination on the basis of race
3. discrimination on the basis of gender identity
4. discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation
5. sexual harassment
6. inciting others to acts of physical or psychological abuse
7. privacy violation
8. derogatory behavior
9. plagiarism
10. defamation and misrepresentation

Those are the basics. The reason for these guidelines is simple: we want to make sure Musescore.com is fun for everyone, and we also need to make sure everything is done legally. Realize that we have the right to enforce the rules by removing content we deem to be in violation of these Guidelines or the Terms of Service, and even to ban users who consistently and/or deliberately break the rules. But we don’t want to be doing that. We want to be helping you share your music. If you feel after reading all this that Musescore.com isn’t for you, that’s OK, but we’ll be sorry to see you go.
